# Mono-Pong-Game
FPGA based single player game designed using various ICs and other electrical stuff. Implemented using Xilinx ZYBO board.

Mono Pong is a variant of the original Pong game in which instead of moving in the two dimensional space, the ball moves in only one dimension (along a straight line) and both the paddles are controlled by a single player. If the player hits the ball with the paddle, it bounces to the other side, increasing his score by one and instead if he missed, the game gets over.
